Question 1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer: The average energy of all the songs in songs.db, which is 0.659 shows that the energy of the songs in the database
is considerably high, which indicate that the listener has a high-energy and positive aura.

Question 2: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
            What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer:
- The data in songs.db is limited to songs from 2018 only, which might not reflect changes in musical preferences over time.
Improvement: Incorporate data from multiple years to capture evolving tastes.
- The dataset might be biased towards the platform's available songs and not include other music sources the listener uses.
Improvement: Integrate data from various music platforms and personal libraries.
